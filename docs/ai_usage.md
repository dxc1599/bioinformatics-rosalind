# AI Usage Notes

I used AI (ChatGPT) to help with:
- Setting up the GitHub repository structure.  
- Step-by-step instructions for adding required files.  
- Clarifying how to create a tagged release for submission.  

All coding, analysis, and notebook work were done by me.  
AI was only used for guidance and explanations.
